Description: OpenOSC package
 OpenOSC is an open-source object size check library written in C. It has been
 developed in order to promote the use of compiler builtin object size check
 capability for enhanced security. It provides lightweight support for detecting
 buffer overflows in various functions that perform operations on memory and
 strings. Not all types of buffer overflows can be detected with this library,
 but it does provide an extra level of validation for some functions that are
 potentially a source of buffer overflow flaws. It protects both C and C++ code.
